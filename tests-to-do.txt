√ should be able to instantiate pencil
√ should be able to instantiate paper
√ pencil should be able to write to paper
√ pencil should have a point durability
√ writing hould decrease pencil durability by 1 per lowercase and 2 per uppercase
√ if pencil durability reaches 0, remaining characters should be blank spaces
- spaces and newlines should not degrade pencil
- pencil should be able to be sharpened
- pencil should be instantiated with a length property
- sharpening pencil should degrade the length by 1
- when length reaches 0, the pencil should not be able to be sharpened anymore
- pencil should be instantiated with an eraser property
- should be able to replace eraser function input with whitespace
- if there are multiple occurences of the word to erase, the last occurence should be erased
- eraser should degrade by 1 per character erase
- if eraser durability reaches 0, then the eraser should stop working
    ex: line: "hello bobby"
    erase: "bobby"
    eraser durability = 3
    line = "hello bo
        ---note: I imagine eraser will go backwards in loop and writing will go forward
- should be able to edit by targeting most recent erased space and write in it.
- if edit input overlaps following characters with a different character, the character should change to a "@'
